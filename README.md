This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Cocktail Recipe Generator

This is a web application built using React. 

It utilizes a free JSON API provided by [TheCocktailDB] (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

This web application allows the user to search the database for a specific cocktail or for an ingredient in the database. 

Selecting a drink will then display the recipe for the cocktail as well as instructions on how to make it.

Selecting an ingredient will show what drinks can be made using that ingredient.

There is also an option for the user to display a random cocktail recipe from the database.
